CLI Builder API
===============
This project is meant to be a helper to abstract some unecessary layers for CLIs development by providing a command schema creator and a single line executor.

## Instalation
    $ npm install cli-builder-api --save

## Usage
### Config
Because CLI Builder API does not need that much, all the informations are kept on your `package.json`Â node's project:

```package.json
{
  "name": "new-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A CLI for console something.",
  "author": "You Name <your@email.com>",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/brab0/new-project#readme",
  "bin": {
    "my-project": "./bin/my-project.js"
  },
  "cliBuilder": {
    "commands": {
      "path": "commands/*.js"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note** that, except for `bin` and `cliBuilder`, all the others are ordinary fields gotten from a `npm init` command. The extra attribute `bin`, informs how we gonna call(`my-project`) and where(`./bin/my-project.js`) npm is gonna find our *executable to symlink for global installs* [see more](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin). The `cliBuilder` tells to our package where our commands files will be. This can be done with support of **wildcards** such: /path/command.*.js, /\**/my-command.js.

### Command Schema
Now the package knows where to find our command, let's create it:

```node
// ./commands/print.js

let cli = require('cli-builder-api');

/*
*  The main method is where you'll put your program's logic. It can has any name, since the 'entry point' be specified in   *  the main field at the command schema.
*  OBS: Any main method has access to the command options inside his param. They are parsed to camelCase in case they are - *  separated.
*/

function main(options) {
    if(options.hello){
        console.log("Your CLI says Hello!");
    } else if(options.goodbye){
        console.log("Your CLI says Goodbye!");
    }
}

cli.command({
    name: 'print',
    abbrev: 'p',
    main : main,
    description : "prints a greeting message",
    options :[{
        name : "hello",
        abbrev : "hl",
        type: Boolean,
        description: "tells to program printing hello"
    }, {
        name : "goodbye",
        abbrev : "bye",
        type: Boolean,
        description: "tells to program printing goodbye"
    }]
});
```

### Executable
We also told in our `package.json` how to call and where is our executable, but does not have it yet. So, let's do it:
```node
// ./bin/my-project.js

#!/usr/bin/env node

require('cli-builder-api').exec();
```

**OBS**: Note that our first line is a [shebang](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/).
