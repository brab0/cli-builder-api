CLI Builder API
===============
This project is meant to be a helper to abstract some unecessary layers for global CLIs development, by providing a command schema creator and a single line executor.

## Instalation
    $ npm install cli-builder-api --save

## Usage
### Config
Because CLI Builder API does not need that much, all the informations are kept on your `package.json`Â node's project:

```package.json
{
  "name": "new-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A CLI for console something.",
  "author": "You Name <your@email.com>",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/brab0/new-project#readme",
  "bin": {
    "my-project": "./bin/my-project.js"
  },
  "cliBuilder": {
    "commands": {
      "path": "commands/*.js"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that, except for `bin` and `cliBuilder`, all the others are ordinary fields gotten from a `npm init` command. The extra attribute `bin`, informs how we gonna call(`my-project`) and where(`./bin/my-project.js`) npm is gonna find our executable to symlink for global installs [see more](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin). The `cliBuilder` tells to our package where our commands files will be.

### Commands Schema
Now our package knows where to find the commands, lets create them. CLI Builder API supplys a command's schema creator, then we can specify our commands:

```node
// ./commands/print.js

let cli = require('cli-builder-api');

function main(options) {
    console.log("exporting with: ", options);
}

cli.command({
    name: 'print',
    abbrev: 'p',
    main : main,
    description : "prints a greeting message",
    options :[{
        name : "hello",
        abbrev : "hl",
        type: Boolean,
        description: "tells to program printing hello"
    }, {
        name : "goodbye",
        abbrev : "bye",
        type: Boolean,
        description: "tells to program printing goodbye"
    }]
});
```
